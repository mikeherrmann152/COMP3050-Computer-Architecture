On this assignment I feel as if I should get around an 85 to a 90. The reason I feel as if it is this grade and not a 100 is because I feel as if my code could have been cleaner and neater. There are no real problems in my code however it can be a little difficult to follow. This is why I gave myself an 85 to a 90 instead of a 100. This is really the only problem I encountered.
