Assignment 6

I believe my grade on this chould be between a 90% and 100%. The reason for this is because my linker.c is capable
of linking several object files into either a resolved executable file or an unresolved consolidated object
file with the -o option. All the assembly source code can be found in the AddInts directory.

for AddInts.exe use command: make AddInts.exe
for AddInts.o use command:   make AddInts.o
