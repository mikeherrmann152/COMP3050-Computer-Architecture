When it comes to the degree of success for this assignment, I feel as if things went fairly well and would expect to get around a 95-100%. With this being said I think there are no problems with my code, everything runs smoothly and I get all the answers when running the code. One issue I ran into was trying to make myself able to put all this in a loop where the user said how many inputs they had, so they didn't have to keep re-running the program. This gave me a problem and I knew it was not neccesary so I decided to leave it out of the program because it did not work with it but it did work without it.
