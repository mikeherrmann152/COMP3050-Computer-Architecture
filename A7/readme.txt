Assignment 7 for COMP3050

I believe I should get a 100% on this program. The reason for this is because it demonstrated the use of the fork()
and pipe() system calls in C as it should. Initially the thread of the program will create a pipe for communication
between processes then fork in order to create the new child process. Then they will bth display the information
about themselves. If there are no errors the program will exit normally.
